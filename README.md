# React-Positionable

Drag, resize, and rotate all in one flexible component.

## Motivation

There are other libraries that offer dragging, resizing, and rotation individually.
However, none of them elegantly combine all three. Additionally, no libraries
handle CSS transformations very well. Most dragging and resizing libraries will
not work as expected when rotation gets involved, due to the semi-complicated
math that has to be done.
