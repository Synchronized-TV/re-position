# re-position

Drag, resize, and rotate all in one flexible component.

## Motivation

Due to the nature of how browsers do CSS transform calculations, combining
inutitive resize and rotation handles is harder than you would imagine
(matrix math anyone?). Let `re-position` do the hard work for you.

## Easy vs Flexible

`re-position` provides two options, depending on your needs. Most users will
benefit from the easy of `PositionableContainer`. It is an absolutely positioned
container (a `div` by default) that you can use right of the box. It provides
an intuitive transform box with handles for rotation and resizing.

For those of us that require more flexibility, there is `Positionable`. It does
not render any HTML elements itself or provide a transform box. Instead, you
are left to do all rendering yourself via render props.
